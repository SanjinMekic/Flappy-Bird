## Features
*Gameplay*: Use the spacebar key to control the bird's altitude. The bird moves upwards when the spacebar is pressed and gradually falls due to gravity.

*Pipes*: Pipes are generated at regular intervals, and the player must navigate the bird through the gaps in the pipes to avoid collisions.

*Scoring*: The game keeps track of your score, which increases every time you successfully navigate the bird through a set of pipes.

*Game Over*: The game ends when the bird collides with a pipe or the screen boundaries.
